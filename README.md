# 🧠 AI vs Human Text Classifier

## 📖 Project Overview

With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated text has become essential in areas such as:

* ✅ Content verification
* 🎓 Academic integrity
* 📱 Digital media analysis

This project develops a **machine learning classifier** that identifies whether a given text is written by a human or generated by AI. It leverages **data mining** and **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques to explore writing patterns and train predictive models.

### 🔑 Key Components

* Preprocessing a labeled dataset containing human and AI-generated text (sourced from Kaggle).
* Implementing and training **LSTM** and **CNN** models using **PyTorch**.
* Evaluating models using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix**.
* Analyzing linguistic features that differentiate AI and human writing styles.
* Entire workflow developed and executed in **Google Colab** using **Python**.

## 🚀 Running the Notebook on Google Colab

1. Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Upload the file `AI_vs_Human_text_analyze.ipynb`.
3. Upload the dataset file `AI_Human.csv`:

   * Click the **folder icon** in the left sidebar.
   * Click the **Upload** button.
   * Select and upload `AI_Human.csv`.
4. After upload, **right-click `AI_Human.csv` → Copy Path**.
5. Paste the path into the CSV loading cell in the notebook.

> 🖼️ *Example:*
>
> ```python
> df = pd.read_csv("/content/AI_Human.csv")
> ```

## 📦 Installing Required Libraries

While Colab has many libraries preinstalled, run this command in the first cell to ensure all dependencies are covered:

```bash
pip install torch transformers pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk tqdm
```

---

## ▶️ Running the Project

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Tokenize the text using **BERT tokenizer**.
3. Train the **LSTM** and **CNN** models.
4. Evaluate model performance using classification metrics.
5. Visualize results using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* Ensure that all file paths in the notebook match the uploaded files.
* Use the Google Colab environment to avoid local installation and GPU setup.
